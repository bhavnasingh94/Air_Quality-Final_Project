# Air_Quality-Final_Project

## Presentation

### Selected Topic

Air Quality Analysis
Counties:
- Alameda County - Urban
- LA County - Urban
- San Luis Obispo County - Rural 
- Fresno County - Agricultural and Rural
- Inyo County - Rural / Mountain / Desert
- Shasta County - Rural Mountain
Placer County - suburban


### Reason

Compare air quality from 2019 - 2020 due to California wildfires

### Description of Source Data

- CARB Link: https://www.arb.ca.gov/qaweb/sitelist_create.php?table=county&code=079
- CIMIS Link: https://cimis.water.ca.gov/Default.aspx
- Valley Air: https://ww2.valleyair.org/air-quality-information
- Air Now: https://www.airnow.gov/?city=Modesto&state=CA&country=USA
- Air Now API: https://docs.airnowapi.org/docs/AirNowAPIFactSheet.pdf
- Air Now API Dataset: http://files.airnowtech.org/

### Questions to Answer

- Which counties' air quality was affected the most?
- How did wind contribute to air quality?
- Which county had better air quality?


### Motivation

Had different experiences with air quality throughout CA, especially during the wildfire season.We want to see how the counties we have listed were affected.

Ideas for visualization and evaluations:

Display PM and Wind data for each location by month, quarter and year.
Monthly and quarterly data could be displayed as 24 data, daytime data and nighttime data.
Yearly data as (average of the monthly data) could be displayed as 24 data, daytime data and nighttime data.
We can review the above visualizations and come up with a conclusion to which locations had highest PM levels. Based on our findings we could do a deeper dive into the data and look at the locations with the highest levels of PM.

Deeper dive - In the locations with the highest PM levels we could
Determine the wind direction that brings in the highest PM levels
Try and correlate PM levels to fires or other issues that would cause high PM levels.

Following Steps: 6/13 - 6/19


Data has been reviewed by Robert,Bhavna and Martin to identify which data to use.
After review, we went ahead and chose the CIMIS data.
Data has been cleaned and plots have been created.

Future Steps: 6/19 - 6/26

Will create a database in Postgres for PM Data.
Tables will be created for wind patterns and air quality.
Note: Data will help to manipulate and gather specific data according to what is needed along the project.
